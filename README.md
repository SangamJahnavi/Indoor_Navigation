# Indoor_Navigation
I developed a mobile application in which the user has to select the desired source and desired destination on the museum map and the app shows the user the shortest
path present between that particular source and destination.
The app is made using react native expo framework.
To create the map I have used figma web application which helped me to design the map.
Firebase is used to store user's credentials and firebase authentication is used for login/signup of the user.
Dijkstras algorithm is used at the backend to find the shortest path between the source and destination.
